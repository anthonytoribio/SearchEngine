# Search Engine Project
## Authors: Derek Naing, Eric Huang, Alejandro Becerra, Anthony Toribio

In this project we implemented a search engine from scratch. This search engine includes
an indexer, a boolean retrieval model, ranking algorithm, and user interface.

### STEP 1: Install Dependencies
Make sure to create a virtual env in server/src/

To run the program you must have the following installed:
* Beautiful Soup https://www.crummy.com/software/BeautifulSoup/bs4/doc/
* NTLK SnowBall https://www.nltk.org/install.html 
* Flask https://flask.palletsprojects.com/en/2.2.x/installation/
* NodeJS https://nodejs.org/en/


## STEP 2:
Build the index

* Run main.py in server/src/
* This takes a while..

## STEP 3:
Start up the server:

* Run server.py in server/src/

## STEP 4:
Run the client:

* In client/, run the following commands:
* npm install
* npm start

* The search engine is now running on localhost on port 3000

## STEP 5:
Search a query:

* Type a query in the search bar and either press enter or click on the magnifying class symbol on the right

## Note:
If you would like to use the voice commands then make sure to run the client on Google Chrome.
