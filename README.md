# Search Engine Project
## Authors: 

In this project we implemented a search engine from scratch. This search engine includes
an indexer, a boolean retrieval model, ranking algorithm, and user interface.

### STEP 1: Install Independencies
Make sure to create a virtual env in server/src

To run the program you must have the following installed:
* Beautiful Soup https://www.crummy.com/software/BeautifulSoup/bs4/doc/
* NTLK SnowBall https://www.nltk.org/install.html 
* Flask https://flask.palletsprojects.com/en/2.2.x/installation/
* NodeJS https://nodejs.org/en/

## STEP 2:
Start up the server:

* Run server.py in server/src/

## STEP 3:
Run the client:

* In client/, run the following commands:
* npm install
* npm start

# NOTE:
* Server and client is configured to run on localhost on port 4999.

* This can be changed in server/src/server.py and client/src/setupProxy.js respectively
